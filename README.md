# pokedex-api-old

**Updated** version at https://github.com/ricardobar96/pokedex-api, where I modified the Api to **return only the first 151 pokemon** (first generation), cleared the layout to **display only one pokemon per row** and changed its **visual appearance**, bringing new functionalities in the form of **menu items** and the possibility to access to a **specific pokemon** view by clicking on it. **Enrique** helped me by **migrating the app to Kotlin** and changing with me **the appearance of the app.**

Api created in Android Studio using Java that brings data from https://pokeapi.co/
